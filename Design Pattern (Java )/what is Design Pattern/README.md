## The Strategy Design Pattern
#### is Used to creat different Algorithm for each object are called at run time.
---
## The Observer Design Pattern
#### defines a 1-to many dependency between object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and update automatically.
---
## The Decorator Design Pattern
#### Decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime. At the same time other instances of the same class will not be affected by this, so individual object gets the modified behavior. Decorator design pattern is one of the structural design pattern (such as Adapter Pattern, Bridge Pattern, Composite Pattern) and uses abstract classes or interface with composition to implement.
